# Data-Source-API-Analyst-Test
# Data Source API Analyst - Homework Assignment

## 📌 Project Description

This repository was created as part of the technical homework for the **Data Source API Analyst** role at Improvado.

The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate the ability to work with REST APIs, specifically the GitHub API, by:
- Understanding data extraction needs
- Testing API endpoints (repositories, commits, file contents)
- Handling authentication, pagination, and error responses
- Documenting the process clearly
- Delivering results via Postman or Google Colab
